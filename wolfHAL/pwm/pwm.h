 * @file pwm.h
 * @brief Generic PWM abstraction and driver interface.
 *
 * Provides a hardware-agnostic API for generating pulse-width-modulated
 * output. The waveform of a channel (frequency, duty, polarity) is described
 * by a whal_Pwm_ChannelCfg passed to Start, which applies it and begins
 * output; Stop halts the channel.
 *
 * Channels are addressed by a zero-based index. A driver returns
 * WHAL_ENOTSUP for any channel its hardware does not implement; a
 * single-output peripheral accepts only channel 0.

 * (prescaled) timer clock. On hardware that shares one counter across
 * channels, every channel of an instance must use the same periodCycles.
